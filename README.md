# ToppleStack
Implementation for ToppleStack data type for Javascript

The idea behind the ToppleStack is simple: if you have a stack, you should be able to pull from places that aren't the top, but if you do, there will be consequences. Specifically, your stack will topple over, leaving you with only the base of your stack. In a ToppleStack, you can pull any element, but all elements above it will be lost. As simple as that!
